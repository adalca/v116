abstract: Localization of an object within an image is a common task in medical imaging.
  Learning to localize or detect objects typically requires the collection of data
  which has been labelled with bounding boxes or similar annotations, which can be
  very time consuming and expensive. A technique which could perform such learning
  with much less annotation would, therefore, be quite valuable. We present such a
  technique for localization with limited annotation, in which the number of images
  with bounding boxes can be a small fraction of the total dataset (e.g. less than
  1{%}); all other images only possess a whole image label and no bounding box. We
  propose a novel loss function for tackling this problem; the loss is a continuous
  relaxation of a well-defined discrete formulation of weakly supervised learning
  and is numerically well-posed. Furthermore, we propose a new architecture which
  accounts for both patch dependence and shift-invariance, through the inclusion of
  CRF layers and anti-aliasing filters, respectively. We apply our technique to the
  localization of thoracic diseases in chest X-ray images and demonstrate state-of-the-art
  localization performance on the ChestX-ray14 dataset.
