abstract: Despite the recent success in applying supervised deep learning to medical
  imaging tasks, the problem of obtaining large and diverse expert-annotated datasets
  required for the development of high performant models remains particularly challenging.
  In this work, we explore the possibility of using Generative Adverserial Networks
  (GAN) to synthesize clinical images with skin condition. We propose DermGAN, an
  adaptation of the popular Pix2Pix architecture, to create synthetic images for a
  pre-specified skin condition while being able to vary its size, location and the
  underlying skin color. We demonstrate that the generated images are of high fidelity
  using objective GAN evaluation metrics. In a Human Turing test, we note that the
  synthetic images are not only visually similar to real images, but also embody the
  respective skin condition in dermatologistsâ€™ eyes. Finally, when using the synthetic
  images as a data augmentation technique for training a skin condition classifier,
  we observe that the model performs comparably to the baseline model overall while
  improving on rare but malignant conditions.
