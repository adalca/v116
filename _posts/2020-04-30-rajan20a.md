abstract: Pulmonary embolisms (PE) are known to be one of the leading causes for cardiac-related
  mortality. Due to inherent variabilities in how PE manifests and the cumbersome
  nature of manual diagnosis, there is growing interest in leveraging AI tools for
  detecting PE. In this paper, we build a two-stage detection pipeline that is accurate,
  computationally efficient, robust to variations in PE types and kernels used for
  CT reconstruction, and most importantly, does not require dense annotations. Given
  the challenges in acquiring expert annotations in large-scale datasets, our approach
  produces state-of-the-art results with very sparse emboli contours (at 10mm slice
  spacing), while using models with significantly lower number of parameters. We achieve
  AUC scores of 0.94 on the validation set and 0.85 on the test set of highly severe
  PEs. Using a large, real-world dataset characterized by complex PE types and patients
  from multiple hospitals, we present an elaborate empirical study and provide guidelines
  for designing highly generalizable pipelines.
