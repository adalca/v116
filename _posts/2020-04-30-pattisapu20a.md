abstract: Medical concept normalization aims to map a variable length message such
  as, ’unable to sleep’ to an entry in a target medical lexicon, such as ’Insomnia’.
  Current approaches formulate medical concept normalization as a supervised text
  classification problem. This formulation has several drawbacks. First, creating
  training data requires manually mapping medical concept mentions to their corresponding
  entries in a target lexicon. Second, these models fail to map a mention to the target
  concepts which were not encountered during the training phase. Lastly, these models
  have to be retrained from scratch whenever new concepts are added to the target
  lexicon. In this work we propose a method which overcomes these limitations. We
  first use various text and graph embedding methods to encode medical concepts into
  an embedding space. We then train a model which transforms concept mentions into
  vectors in this target embedding space. Finally, we use cosine similarity to find
  the nearest medical concept to a given input medical concept mention. Our model
  scales to millions of target concepts and trivially accommodates growing target
  lexicon size without incurring significant computational cost. Experimental results
  show that our model outperforms the previous state-of-the-art by 4.2{%} and 6.3{%}
  classification accuracy across two benchmark datasets. We also present a variety
  of studies to evaluate the robustness of our model under different training conditions.
