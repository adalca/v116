abstract: The task of localizing and categorizing objects in medical images often
  remains formulated as a semantic segmentation problem. This approach, however, only
  indirectly solves the coarse localization task by predicting pixel-level scores,
  requiring ad-hoc heuristics when mapping back to object-level scores. State-of-the-art
  object detectors on the other hand, allow for individual object scoring in an end-to-end
  fashion, while ironically trading in the ability to exploit the full pixel-wise
  supervision signal. This can be particularly disadvantageous in the setting of medical
  image analysis, where data sets are notoriously small. In this paper, we propose
  Retina U-Net, a simple architecture, which naturally fuses the Retina Net one-stage
  detector with the U-Net architecture widely used for semantic segmentation in medical
  images. The proposed architecture recaptures discarded supervision signals by complementing
  object detection with an auxiliary task in the form of semantic segmentation without
  introducing the additional complexity of previously proposed two-stage detectors.
  We evaluate the importance of full segmentation supervision on two medical data
  sets, provide an in-depth analysis on a series of toy experiments and show how the
  corresponding performance gain grows in the limit of small data sets. Retina U-Net
  yields strong detection performance only reached by its more complex two-staged
  counterparts. Our framework including all methods implemented for operation on 2D
  and 3D images is available at github.com/pfjaeger/medicaldetectiontoolkit.
