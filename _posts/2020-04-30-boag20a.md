abstract: 'With advances in deep learning and image captioning over the past few years,
  researchers have recently begun applying computer vision methods to radiology report
  generation. Typically, these generated reports have been evaluated using general
  domain natural language generation (NLG) metrics like CIDEr and BLEU. However, there
  is little work assessing how appropriate these metrics are for healthcare, where
  correctness is critically important. In this work, we profile a number of models
  for automatic report generation on this dataset, including: random report retrieval,
  nearest neighbor report retrieval, n-gram language models, and neural network approaches.
  These models serve to calibrate our understanding for what the opaque general domain
  NLG metrics mean. In particular, we find that the standard NLG metrics (e.g. BLEU,
  CIDEr) actually assign higher scores to random (but grammatical) clinical sentences
  over n-gram-derived sentences, despite the n-gram sentences achieving higher clinical
  accuracy. This casts doubt on the usefulness of these domain-agnostic metrics, though
  unsurprisingly we find that the best performance-on both CIDEr/BLEU and clinical
  correctness-was achieved by more sophisticated models.'
