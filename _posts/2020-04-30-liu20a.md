abstract: Early detection is a crucial goal in the study of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD).
  In this work, we describe several techniques to boost the performance of 3D convolutional
  neural networks trained to detect AD using structural brain MRI scans. Specifically,
  we provide evidence that (1) instance normalization outperforms batch normalization,
  (2) early spatial downsampling negatively affects performance, (3) widening the
  model brings consistent gains while increasing the depth does not, and (4) incorporating
  age information yields moderate improvement. Together, these insights yield an increment
  of approximately 14{%} in test accuracy over existing models when distinguishing
  between patients with AD, mild cognitive impairment, and controls in the ADNI dataset.
  Similar performance is achieved on an independent dataset.
