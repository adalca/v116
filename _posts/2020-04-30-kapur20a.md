abstract: We present the first non-invasive real-time silent speech system that helps
  patients with speech disorders to communicate in natural language voicelessly, merely
  by articulating words or sentences in the mouth without producing any sounds. We
  collected neuromus-cular recordings to build a dataset of 10 trials of 15 sentences
  from each of 3 multiple sclerosis (MS) patients with dysphonia, spanning a range
  of severity and subsequently affected speech attributes. We present a pipeline wherein
  we carefully preprocess the data, develop a convolutional neural architecture and
  employ personalized machine learning. In our experiments with multiple sclerosis
  patients, our system achieves a mean overall test accuracy of 0.81 at a mean information
  transfer rate of 203.73 bits per minute averaged over all patients. Our work demonstrates
  the potential of a reliable and promising human-computer interface that classifies
  intended sentences from silent speech and hence, paves the path for future work
  with further speech disorders in conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
  (ALS), stroke, and oral cancer, among others.
