abstract: Falling can have fatal consequences for the elderly people especially if
  the fallen person is unable to call for help due to loss of consciousness or any
  other associated injury. Automatic fall detection systems can assist in overcoming
  this issue through prompt fall alarms which then allow the triggering of a third
  party response, and to minimize the fear of falling when living independently at
  home. Vision-based fall detection systems detect human regions in the scene and
  use information from these regions to train classifiers for fall recognition. However,
  the performance of these systems lack generalization to unseen environments due
  to factors such as errors in the human detection stage and the unavailability of
  large-scale fall datasets to learn robust features for fall recognition. In this
  paper, we present a deep learning based framework towards automatic fall detection
  from RGB images captured by a single camera. Our framework learns human skeleton
  and segmentation based fall representations purely from synthetic data generated
  in a virtual environment. This de-identifies personal information contained in the
  original images and preserves privacy which is highly desirable in health informatics.
  Experiments on challenging real-world fall datasets show that our framework performs
  successful transfer of fall recognition knowledge from synthetic to real-world data
  and achieves high sensitivity and specificity scores showcasing its generalization
  capability for highly accurate fall detection in unseen real-world environments.
