abstract: 'Previous work on automated pain detection from facial expressions has primarily
  focused on frame-level pain metrics based on specific facial muscle activations,
  such as Prkachin and Solomon Pain Intensity (PSPI). However, the current gold standard
  pain metric is the patientâ€™s self-reported visual analog scale (VAS) level which
  is a video-level measure. In this work, we propose a multitask multidimensional-pain
  model to directly predict VAS from video. Our model consists of three stages: (1)
  a VGGFace neural network model trained to predict frame-level PSPI, where multitask
  learning is applied, i.e. individual facial action units are predicted together
  with PSPI, to improve the learning of PSPI; (2) a fully connected neural network
  to estimate sequence-level pain scores from frame-level PSPI predictions, where
  again we use multitask learning to learn multidimensional pain scales instead of
  VAS alone; and (3) an optimal linear combination of the multidimensional pain predictions
  to obtain a final estimation of VAS. We show on the UNBC-McMaster Shoulder Pain
  dataset that our multitask multidimensional-pain method achieves state-of-the-art
  performance with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.95 and an intraclass correlation
  coefficient (ICC) of 0.43. While still not as good as trained human observer predictions
  provided with the dataset, when we average our estimates with those human estimates,
  our model improves their MAE from 1.76 to 1.58. Trained on the UNBC-McMaster dataset
  and applied directly with no further training or fine-tuning on a separate dataset
  of facial videos recorded during post-appendectomy physical exams, our model also
  outperforms previous work by 6{%} on the Area under the ROC curve metric (AUC).'
