abstract: Learning a classifier in safety-critical applications like medicine raises
  several issues. Firstly, the class proportions, also called priors, are in general
  imbalanced or uncertain. Secondly, the classifier must consider some bounds on the
  priors taking the form of box constraints provided by experts. Thirdly, it is also
  necessary to consider any arbitrary loss function given by experts to evaluate the
  classification decision. Finally, the dataset may contain both categorical and numerical
  features. To deal with both categorical and numerical features, the numerical attributes
  are discretized. When considering only discrete features, we propose in this paper
  a box-constrained minimax classifier which addresses all the mentioned issues. We
  derive a projected subgradient algorithm to compute this classifier. The convergence
  of this algorithm is established. We finally perform experiments on the Framingham
  heart database for illustrating the relevance of our algorithm in health care field.
