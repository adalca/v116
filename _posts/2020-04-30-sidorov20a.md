abstract: In minimally invasive surgery, the use of tissue dissection tools causes
  smoke, which inevitably degrades the image quality. This could reduce the visibility
  of the operation field for surgeons and introduces errors for the computer vision
  algorithms used in surgical navigation systems. In this paper, we propose a novel
  approach for computational smoke removal using supervised image-to-image translation.
  We demonstrate that straightforward application of existing generative algorithms
  allows removing smoke but decreases image quality and introduces synthetic noise
  (grid-structure). Thus, we propose to solve this issue by modification of GANâ€™s
  architecture and adding perceptual image quality metric to the loss function. Obtained
  results demonstrate that proposed method efficiently removes smoke as well as preserves
  perceptually sufficient image quality.
