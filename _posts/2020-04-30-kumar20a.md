abstract: Healthcare resource allocation is an application that has been largely neglected
  by the machine learning community. We utilize the Electronic Health Records (EHR)
  of 1.4 million Finnish citizens, aged 65 and above, to develop a sequential deep
  learning model to predict utilization of healthcare services in the following year
  on individual level. Historical longitudinal EHR records from previous years, consisting
  of diagnosis codes, procedures, and patient demographics, are used sequentially
  as an input to a Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). We improve the standard RNN regression
  pipeline for EHR code sequences by adding a Convolutional Embedding layer to address
  multiple codes recorded simultaneously, and Multi-headed attention. This reduces
  the number of epochs to converge by approximately 38{%} while improving the accuracy.
  We achieve approximately 10{%} improvement in R 2 score compared with state-of-the-art
  count-based baselines. Finally, we demonstrate the model’s robustness to changes
  in healthcare practices over time, by showing that it retains it’s ability to predict
  well into future years without any data available at the time of prediction, which
  is needed in practice to aid the allocation of healthcare resources.
