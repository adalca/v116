abstract: Multi-language speech datasets are scarce and often have small sample sizes
  in the medical domain. Robust transfer of linguistic features across languages could
  improve rates of early diagnosis and therapy for speakers of low-resource languages
  when detecting health conditions from speech. We utilize out-of-domain, unpaired,
  single-speaker, healthy speech data for training multiple Optimal Transport (OT)
  domain adaptation systems. We learn mappings from other languages to English and
  detect aphasia from linguistic characteristics of speech, and show that OT domain
  adaptation improves aphasia detection over unilingual baselines for French (6{%}
  increased F1) and Mandarin (5{%} increased F1). Further, we show that adding aphasic
  data to the domain adaptation system significantly increases performance for both
  French and Mandarin, increasing the F1 scores further (10{%} and 8{%} increase in
  F1 scores for French and Mandarin, respectively, over unilingual baselines).
